## 📖 About The Project

**JobScraper AI** is not your typical keyword-based job board. It utilizes a curated dataset of job offers collected by a high-performance **Go (Golang)** scraping engine and leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to understand the *meaning* of job titles.

Using a dedicated Python microservice, the system generates vector embeddings for your search queries in real-time. This allows users to search for "Software Engineer" and find results for "Backend Developer" or "Fullstack Programmer" thanks to semantic similarity search powered by `sqlite-vec`.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Semantic AI Search
Don't worry about exact keywords. Type what you are looking for, and our **Vector Search Engine** will find the most contextually similar offers.
* *Powered by `sentence-transformers` & `sqlite-vec` for high-performance local vector similarity.*

</div>

### 🔍 Smart Filtering & Pagination
We prioritize user experience with intuitive controls:
* **Recency Sorting:** Automatically displays fresh listings first, ensuring you never miss the newest opportunities.
* **Navigation:** Browse through hundreds of offers using navigation buttons.
* **Custom Limits:** You decide how many offers to see per page using the dropdown selector.

## 🏗️ How It Works (Architecture)

The system is designed to perform fast read-heavy operations on a pre-built dataset generated by an external high-concurrency pipeline.

1.  **Data Collection (External Pipeline):**
    * A specialized scraping engine written in **Go (Golang)** crawls multiple job boards to aggregate offers.
    * The **AI Service** calculates vector embeddings for all collected titles.
    * The combined data (metadata + vectors) is saved into a portable SQLite database.
    
2.  **Runtime Application (This Repo):**
    * The application mounts this pre-populated `.db` file, ensuring zero-latency startup and no runtime scraping overhead.

3.  **AI Service (Python):**
    * Acts as a runtime vectorizer using the **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** model.
    * Converts the user's **search query** into a high-dimensional vector to match it against the database.

4.  **Core Backend (NestJS + Prisma):**
    * Orchestrates the flow between the UI, the AI Service, and the Database.
    * Serves the frontend using **Handlebars (HBS)** templates.

5.  **Database (SQLite + sqlite-vec):**
    * Performs the actual mathematical heavy lifting.
    * Uses `sqlite-vec` to execute search between the *query vector* (from Python) and the *job vectors* (stored in DB).

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose

### Running with Docker

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JobScrapper-io/JobScraper.git
    cd JobScraper
    ```

2.  **Build and Run**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    * The App will start at: `http://localhost:3000`
    * The AI Service will start at: `http://localhost:8000`

## 💻 Usage

1.  Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Search:** Enter a job title (e.g., "Python Developer"). The system sends your text to the AI Service to create a vector, then queries the database.
3.  **Browse:** Use the dropdown to change the number of results per page.
4.  **Navigate:** Use the page navigation buttons to scroll through results.
5.  **Apply:** Select a job card to view full details and navigate to the original source to apply.
